										<h2 id="content">Games I play</h2>
										<p>In my free time I like to play a lot of video games with friends.
                                            I play many kinds of video games, but I mainly enjoy genres such as rogue-like, open-world,
                                            survival, sandbox and games similar to that. My favourite game as of now is probably terraria, a 2D
                                            adventure sandbox RPG game. I have been playing that game most of my life so it has a special
                                            place in my heart.</p>

												<h3>What I play on</h3>
												<p>I mostly play games on my computer. I play a lot of online games with my friends.
                                                 However, I do own some consoles and play on them quite frequently as well. For example,
                                                 I play on my Nintendo Switch a lot whenever I want to chill out and have a relaxing experience.</p>

												<h3>Game Development</h3>
												<p>As far as game development, I haven't made much. However I have used simple
                                                coding applications such as "Scratch". I have joined the Games Development Society in
                                                UL and I am hoping to be able to make a simple but fun game. As far as I know there
                                                 is also a module later on in my course that exposes me to games dev and I am
                                                 really looking forward to that.</p>
